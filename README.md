# CS61B Data Structures 

Below is the course description/details. Completed the course assignments as a personal challenge and to learn more about data structures. The link below shows all project/hw/lab descriptions. All course material has been completed with the exception of project 3 due to my desire to devote my time to other projects. I have also developed a similar personal project [kismet](https://github.com/QuantuMope/kismet) <br />

## Overview

*Java Fundamentals*

- The compile/execute cycle.
- Primitive data types (integer, floating point, character, boolean); arrays; classes.
- Interactive control structures.
- Functions; recursion; overloading.
- Inheritance; interfaces; exceptions; threads.

*Data Structure and Algorithms*

- Construction, modification, and traversal of linked list structures of various forms -- singly-linked, doubly-linked, and circular, with and without sentinels.
- Construction, modification, and traversal of binary trees (in particular, binary search trees and expression trees).
- Sorting of sequences by selection, insertion, quicksort, merge sort; binary search through a binary search tree of a sorted sequence.
- Binary heaps.
- Hashing.
- Elementary graph structures and algorithms.

## HW and Labs

<p align="justify">
There are 14 weeks of lab in the course, as well as 5 required homeworks. In addition there is 1 makeup lab as well as 2 makeup homeworks that you can optionally complete at any time before the final exam to replace a lower score.
<br><br>
During Phase I of the course (Weeks 1 through 4), labs will provide you with help getting your computer set up and how to use essential Java programming tools. During Phase II of the course (Weeks 5 through 7), labs will provide you with structure for the open ended design project (project 2). In Phase III of the course, labs will give you a chance to implement important data structures and algorithms. All labs will take approximately two hours to complete, though some may run slightly longer. HWs will vary from 3 to 10 hours of work. You will turn in everything electronically using GitHub, and your results will be available on Gradescope. All homeworks and labs are individual efforts (without partners). Two of the homeworks and one of the labs will be released during RRR week. If you complete all of your work during the semester, you don't need to do these (as they will be dropped). For the three labs with no official work to turn in (labs 6, 7, and 12, subject to change), everybody gets full credit automatically, even if they do not attend lab that week.

## Programming Projects
<p align="justify">
In addition to the HWs and labs, there will be 4 programming projects. In these projects you will build an entire system. For project 0, you will be able to work with a partner. For project 2 you will be required to work with a partner, unless you specifically request otherwise (details TBA).
<br><br>
Project 0 and 1 will be relatively easier than projects 2 and 3, taking less time and with greater levels of scaffolding. Project 2 will be a very difficult project (on par with what you might expect from Hilfinger's harder projects). Project 3 will be challenging, but not as time consuming as project 2.
</p>

Each project has a specific theme:

- Project 0: Introduction to Java
- Project 1: Basic Design, Testing, and Code Review
- Project 2: Large Scale Design and Testing
- Project 3: Working with an Existing Code Base
